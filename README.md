hammr
=====

An assortment of utility functions originally developed for the Austrian freight 
transport statistics, but with general applicability. Hammr is an experimental
package and API stability is not guranteed; however, parts of hammr that have 
proven useful in the past were  were refactored into their own packages, such as 
  [dint](https://github.com/s-fleck/dint),
  [dsinfo](https://github.com/s-fleck/dint),
  and [tabde](https://github.com/s-fleck/dint).
